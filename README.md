# NEIGHBOURHOOD

Neighbourhood is a simple API allowing consumers to:
* Store information about the household members, houses and addresses; 
* Provide the lookup of the house, owners and address;  
* Find people in the neighbourhood according the age groups or household sizes;

The application uses REST architecture. It uses common [HTTP response](https://cybersguards.com/http-response-codes/)codes. Accepts [form encoded](https://dev.to/sidthesloth92/understanding-html-form-encoding-url-encoded-and-multipart-forms-3lpa)  data and returns JSON format data.
